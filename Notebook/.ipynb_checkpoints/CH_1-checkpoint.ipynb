    "Python is an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. [\\[wikipedia\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) Since Python is a dynamic script language, Python scripts rely on Pyhton interpreter to run. On the contrary, compiled languages like C/C++ directly run on target machines. \n",
    "\n",
    "So the question is, how does interpreter work? Actually interpreter runs on the target machines directly just like any compiled and linked executive programs. And Python scripts run inside the interpreter, during which time interpreter translate the scripts into some intermediate language codes, execute these codes, allocate memory of the host machine, and get input from / set output to the host machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can conclude that implementing Python is implementing Python interpreter to some extent. In fact Python interpreter is implemented with C, a quite classic but powerful language. And topics related to implementing Python with C is called *\"CPython\"*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still there are some alternative implementation of Python, and please refer to [\\[Alternate Implementations\\]](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/introduction.html#alternate-implementations)\n"
